It contains image predictions from a neural network, provided by the Udacity team.\n",

    "After data assessment, the next step was data cleaning - which involves programatically solving the challenges from the data assessment. The following challenges were recognised in the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. missing values `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`, `retweeted_status_timestamp`\n",
    "2. irrelevant columns (`in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`, `retweeted_status_timestamp`, `expanded_urls`)\n",
    "3. url string in `source`\n",
    "4. no dog stage has been indicated for some dogs\n",
    "5. erroneous data types(`timestamp`)\n",
    "6. some tweets do not have images\n",
    "7. some tweets are retweets\n",
    "8. some tweets have multiple dog stages\n",
    "9. not all values in `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are dog breeds\n",
    "10. lower case and upper case sometimes in `p1`, `p2`, amd `p3`\n",
    "11. missing records (2354 instead of 2356)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identified Data Tidiness Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `doggo`, `floofer`, `pupper`, `puppo` should be observations in one column `dog_stage`\n",
    "2. multiple columns each for predictions, confidence level, and breed\n",
    "3. `tweet_id` should be present in `twitter_archive` table \n",
    "4. `favorites`, and `retweets` should be added to the twitter_archive table\n",
    "5. `tweet_id` should be present in `twitter_archive` table \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The following where the resolutions, as necesary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dropping columns with missing data and those with null value in image_num column.\n",
    "2. Changed data types for dates from String to datetime.\n",
    "3. Updating and reformating URL in to correct format.\n",
    "4. Deleting rows in `text` begining with 'RT', and rows that indicated as false in `prediction`.\n",
    "5. Concatenating and reshaping columns, and merging tables.\n",
    "6. Changing case to lowercase.\n",
    "7. Merging three tables to create master dataframe and saving it as twitter_archive_master.\n"
