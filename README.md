# Data Analysis Report Readme
## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis report that explores various aspects of a Twitter dataset related to dog ratings. The analysis aims to answer three main research questions:

Which breed has the highest viewer engagement?
Does the time of the tweet affect the level of interactions?
Is there a correlation between dog stage and engagement?
The analysis was performed using Python programming language with popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Files
The repository contains the following files:

> 1. data_analysis_report.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code for the data analysis. It includes the data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and conclusions.

> 2. data_clean.csv: This is a CSV file containing the cleaned version of the original Twitter dataset used in the analysis.

> 3. tweet_image_predictions.tsv: This is a TSV file containing image predictions for dog breeds that were used in the analysis.

> 4. README.md (this file): A markdown file providing an overview of the data analysis report.

## Research Questions and Observations
The data analysis report addresses the following research questions and provides the corresponding observations:

> 1. Which breed has more engagement? The analysis found that the Saluki breed received the highest average favorites and retweets.

> 2. Does the time of the tweet affect the level of interactions? Tweets posted within the hour of 6 am received the highest average favorites and retweets, while tweets posted within the hour of 1 pm received the lowest average favorites and retweets.

> 3. Is there a correlation between dog stage and engagement? The analysis showed that the "floofer" and "puppo" dog stages received the highest average ratings.

## Limitations
> 1. The data analysis report has the following limitations:

> 2. The analysis relies on a specific dataset with data collected until a certain date. More recent data may provide different insights.

> 3. The dataset was obtained through a text file, which might not include all the latest updates or changes on Twitter.

> 4. The analysis may be affected by any inaccuracies or biases present in the original data source.

> 5. The analysis does not take into account external factors that could impact engagement, such as current events or popular trends.

## Acknowledgments
> The original Twitter dataset used in this analysis was provided by Udacity. The dataset contains information about dog ratings and was gathered from the WeRateDogs Twitter account.

## About
> This data analysis report was created as part of a data analysis project for educational purposes. The analysis and code were written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook as the development environment. For any questions or inquiries, please contact the author.
